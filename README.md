## Overview

QuickMed Calc is a lightweight, offline-capable desktop application designed by and for medical professionals. It consolidates commonly used medical calculators and clinical decision aids into a single, easy-to-use interface.

**Created by a General Physician for real-world clinical use.**

## Features

### üßÆ **Core Medical Calculators**
- **BMI Calculator** - With standard WHO categories
- **Body Surface Area (BSA)** - Mosteller formula
- **Creatinine Clearance** - Cockcroft-Gault equation with staging
- **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)** - Complete neurological assessment
- **Wells Score** - DVT risk stratification
- **APGAR Score** - Newborn assessment
- **Pediatric Dosing** - Weight-based medication calculations
- **CHADS‚ÇÇ Score** - Stroke risk with anticoagulation guidance

### ‚ö° **Quick Access Features**
- **Instant Search** - Type "gcs" to find Glasgow Coma Scale
- **Offline Operation** - Works without internet connection
- **Patient Notes** - Built-in note-taking for each calculation
- **Calculation History** - SQLite database stores all results
- **Professional UI** - Clean, medical-appropriate interface

### üíæ **Data Management**
