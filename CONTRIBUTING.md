   ```

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Provide clear description
   - Include medical references for new calculations
   - Tag relevant issues

#### **Code Standards**

##### **Medical Calculator Requirements**
Every new calculator MUST include:

```python
def create_new_calculator(self):
    """
    Calculator Name - Brief Description
    
    Medical Reference:
    - Primary source: [Journal/Guideline]
    - Formula validation: [Date checked]
    - Clinical context: [When to use]
    
    IMPORTANT: All calculations must be independently verified
    """
```

##### **Code Structure**
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use descriptive variable names
- Include input validation
- Provide clear error messages
- Add result interpretation where appropriate

##### **Medical Validation**
```python
# Example of proper medical validation
def calculate_gcs(eye, verbal, motor):
    """
    Glasgow Coma Scale Calculator
    
    Reference: Teasdale & Jennett, Lancet 1974
    Validation: Cross-checked with current neurosurgical guidelines
    """
    # Input validation
    if not all(isinstance(x, int) for x in [eye, verbal, motor]):
        raise ValueError("All GCS components must be integers")
    
    if not (1 <= eye <= 4):
        raise ValueError("Eye opening must be 1-4")
    # ... additional validation
    
    total = eye + verbal + motor
    
    # Clinical interpretation based on current guidelines
    if total >= 13:
        interpretation = "Mild brain injury"
    # ... rest of interpretation
    
    return total, interpretation
```

#### **New Calculator Checklist**

- [ ] **Medical accuracy verified** against current literature
- [ ] **Edge cases handled** (invalid inputs, extreme values)
- [ ] **Clinical interpretations** included where appropriate
- [ ] **Proper error handling** with user-friendly messages
- [ ] **Consistent UI** following existing patterns
- [ ] **Database integration** for saving calculations
- [ ] **Documentation** in code and README
- [ ] **Testing** completed on multiple scenarios

### Adding New Calculators

#### **Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Research the Calculator**
   - Find the original medical literature
   - Verify the current standard formula
   - Understand clinical context and limitations

2. **Add to Calculator Registry**
   ```python
   self.calculators = {
       # existing calculators...
       'new_calc': 'New Calculator Name'
   }
   ```

3. **Create Calculator Method**
   ```python
   def create_new_calculator(self):
       calc_frame, result_frame, notes_frame = self.create_calculator_frame("Calculator Title")
       # Implementation here
   ```

4. **Add to Load Function**
   ```python
   def load_calculator(self, calc_type):
       # existing conditions...
       elif calc_type == 'new_calc':
           self.create_new_calculator()
   ```

#### **Medical Reference Format**
```python
"""
MEDICAL REFERENCE:
Primary Source: Author et al. Journal Name. Year;Volume:Pages
Alternative Sources: [List any supporting references]
Last Verified: [Date]
Clinical Context: [When and why to use this calculator]
Limitations: [Known limitations or contraindications]
"""
```

## Testing Guidelines

### **For Medical Professionals**
- Test with real (anonymized) patient scenarios
- Verify against manual calculations
- Check edge cases (very high/low values)
- Ensure interpretations match clinical guidelines

### **For Developers**
```bash
# Run the application
python src/main.py

# Test each calculator with:
# - Normal values
# - Edge cases
# - Invalid inputs
# - Database saving functionality
```

## Submitting Issues

### **Bug Reports**
Include:
- Calculator name
- Input values used
- Expected vs actual result
- Medical reference supporting expected result

### **Feature Requests**
Include:
- Calculator name and medical use case
- Primary medical literature reference
- Frequency of use in clinical practice
- Target medical specialties

## Code Review Process

### **Medical Review**
All medical calculators require:
1. **Accuracy verification** by medical professional
2. **Literature validation** with current sources
3. **Clinical utility** assessment

### **Technical Review**
All code changes require:
1. **Code quality** review
2. **Testing** verification
3. **Documentation** completeness

## Community Guidelines
